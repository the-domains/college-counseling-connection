  we value what makes us feel safe?

# Less is more! 

# Creating a meaningful college list

College is so much more than the place where you earn a diploma. It is an experience, it is a mindset, it is a world where you can take risks and be rewarded with a new and improved adult version of you! WHERE you go does matter, but not in the way that we often think about it. Rankings can get the best of us (or rather, the best of your parents) and we give more value to rankings then they deserve. Why don't we value what feeds our soul? Why don't we value what makes us feel safe?

More and more, high schools are limiting the number of applications that a student can apply to and students are freaking out! Their immediate reaction is, "what if I don't get in to my top choices?" and "I need more options!" If you do your research and truly know the institutions that you apply to and why they are right for you and why you are right for them, 10 applications is more than enough.

So many students make a decision about where to apply and attend based on the ranking. I have worked with many students who make the same choice and ultimately end up dropping out or transferring. When we do not feel safe or connected to our community, we don't take risks. When we don't take risks we don't grow. Vulnerability is ok, and feeling disconnected can be dangerous to your well being.
